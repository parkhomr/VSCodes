In this assignment, I completed two parts: creating a test mark report program and implementing foolproof input validation functions. 
For Part 1, I focused on writing a program that calculates the average of student marks and prints a report that includes the class 
average and its corresponding letter grade. This required writing functions to get the number of students, calculate the average of 
their marks, and convert the average into a letter grade.
For Part 2, I implemented several input validation functions (getInt, getIntMM, getDouble, and getDoubleMM). 
These functions ensure that only valid integers or doubles are accepted, and they validate the input to fall within a specific range if needed.
I reused the teacher’s method for input validation, using scanf() to read values and check for trailing characters to ensure the input is valid.
While working on Part 2, I had some difficulties when trying to apply the teacher’s method from getInt() to the other functions, 
especially for handling double inputs and maintaining proper input validation. However, with trial and error, I managed to adapt 
the method successfully and learned how to handle different types of inputs effectively.
